# Facial-Recognition

This is a facial recognition project that tries to map labelled faces to an attendance sheet. Using opencv, the program uses a built-in or USB webcam to detect faces and record the attendance live in an excel sheet. The sheet lists the people recognized and the timestamp associated with that person. This is meant to be further developed so that people can be tracked entering and exiting buildings.
